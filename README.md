# Practice_BashScripting
This task aims to assess our knowledge in Bash Scripting by having us complete fifteen (15) Bash shell scripts. It also validates our ability to create an AWS resource, namely an EC2 instance, and successfully SSH into it. Finally, the task requires us to push our scripts to a GitHub repository.
